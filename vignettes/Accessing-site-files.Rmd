## Downloading a site file

To access a site file - a collated set of data for a specific country - you will
need to follow these steps:

1. Sign up for a [github account](URL), single user accounts are free.

2. Send an email to malariaverse@imperial.ac.uk to ask for site file access. 
Please include the following details:

  * Your name
  * Your institution
  * Your github username
  * A short description of the project you will use the site files for
  
3. You will then be added to the malariaverse github team.

When you receive confirmation of this (look out for a notification on github), you
can then use the `site` package inbuilt functionality to download site files.

You can call `fetch_site()`, specifying the [ISO3c country code](URL) of your
country of interest. For example, for Nigeria: `fetch_site(iso3c = "NGA")`.

The first time you do this, you will see interactive authentication instructions
asking you to access a github link and providing an authentication code. Open
the link and copy the code to authorise access. This process should cache your
credentials so that you don't have to authorise every time.

## Updates and versioning

Site files will be periodically updated. When you call `fetch_site()`, by default
you will be accessing the most recent version of the site file. The version can
be identified XXX here and you will be able to access older versions of the site
files by specifying additional arguments (e.g XXXX) when calling `fetch_site()`.
Older versions may no longer be supported with the malariaverse packages.

News on new updates will be posted [here](URL).

## Issues

If you encounter any issues with this process, please post an issue, with as much
detail as possible on the [site package issue page](URL).
