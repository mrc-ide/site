## Seasonality

`site_file$seasonality`

Daily rainfall global rasters for the period 2019-2021 were obtained from 
CHIRPS @CHIRPS using the 
[umbrella R package](https://mrc-ide.github.io/umbrella/). For each site we
estimate the fourier series parameters representing general seasonal profiles. 
Please see the umbrella website for more information.
