## Seasonality

`site_file$seasonality`

Daily rainfall global rasters for the period 2000-2024 were obtained from 
CHIRPS @CHIRPS using the 
[umbrella R package](https://mrc-ide.github.io/umbrella/). For each site we
estimate the fourier series parameters representing general seasonal profiles. 
Please see the umbrella website for more information.

`site_file$seasonality$seasonality_parameters` Contains the estimated fourier
series parameters.

`site_file$seasonality$monthly_rainfall` Contains the extracted rainfall estimate

`site_file$seasonality$fourier_prediction` Contains a prediction of the seasonal
curve using the estimated parameters
