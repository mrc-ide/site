## Cases and deaths

`site_file$cases_deaths`

Where available this includes the time series of cases and deaths for the country
as reported in previous editions of the world malaria report. Other useful data
include the world malaria report @WMR population at risk and uncertainty intervals for
estimates.

## Prevalence

`site_file$prevalence`

Where available this includes the population at risk weighted average parasite
prevalence time series from the Malaria Atlas Project @MAP

_Plasmodium falciparuim_ parasite prevalence (`PfPr`) is reported for children aged 
between 2-10 years, summarized from the malaria atlas project raster entitled:
"Plasmodium falciparum PR2 - 10 version 2020".

_Plasmodium vivax_ parasite prevalence (`PvPr`) is reported for individuals aged 
between 1-99 years, summarized from the malaria atlas project raster entitled:
"Plasmodium vivax PR1-99 version 2020".

Prevalence estimates are used for calibrating the baseline EIR using the [cali package](https://mrc-ide.github.io/cali/).
