## Population projections

`site_file$population`

Site-level population estimates are extracted at the pixel level from 
WorldPop @worldpop. We use the "Unconstrained individual 
countries 2000-2020 UN adjusted ( 1km resolution )" rasters.

### Urban rural 

Urban rural splits within administrative unit are defined using a threshold
density of 1500 people per square km.

### Population at risk

`site_file$population$par_pf`
`site_file$population$par_pv`
`site_file$population$par`

Population at risk from _Plasmodium falciparum_, _Plasmodium vivax_ or both are
estimated by masking the total population raster by areas with active transmission 
(prevalence >0%) in year 2000 @MAP.

### Population growth and urbanisation

We provide annual population projections to 2050 using UN data on total population
growth @unwpp combined with UN projections of 
the levels of urbanisation @UNWUP.
We use these projections to produces estimates of the rate of urban and rural
growth (relative to a baseline year) which are then applied to our spatial-unit
population estimates. Final estimates are rescaled to ensure that
population total match UN totals.

## Demography

Population demographics (age structure) are defined over time for each site.
Demography is obtained using the [peeps R package](https://github.com/mrc-ide/peeps),
and are based on data from the UN WPP @unwpp.

Mortality rates are specified for neonates (0-30 days), young infants 
(31 days - 1 year), older infants (1 year - 5 years) and then in five year age 
bands.
