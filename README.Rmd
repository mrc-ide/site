The site package supports malariaverse users to:

1. Access and download the latest country site-files üåê ‚û°Ô∏è üíª
2. Translate site file information into malariasimulation parameters üåç ‚û°Ô∏è üìâ

## The site-file

The site-file is the file storing all of the sub nationally disaggregated 
information for a country. Components of the site-file include:

1. The [Metadata](https://mrc-ide.github.io/site/articles/Metadata.html), with 
high level information about the country and site-file version.
2. [Historical Epidemiological Data](https://mrc-ide.github.io/site/articles/historical_epi.html)
with estimates of cases, deaths and parasite prevalence.
3. [Population and Demography](https://mrc-ide.github.io/site/articles/pop_demog.html)
information.
4. Estimates of the [Historical Intervention Use](https://mrc-ide.github.io/site/articles/Interventions.html)
in the country.
5. [Rainfalll and Seasonality](https://mrc-ide.github.io/site/articles/Seasonality.html) data.
6. Information on the [Mosquito Vectors](https://mrc-ide.github.io/site/articles/vectors.html) 

## Accessing and downloading site-files

Please see [this detailed guide](https://mrc-ide.github.io/site/articles/Accessing-site-files.html) for information on how to gain access and download site files.

## Translating site-file information to malariasimulation parameters

If we have access a site file, then all we need to 
do to run the model is

1. Isolate a single site, this is a single sub-national unit within the country
2. Create the parameter list
3. Pass that to malariasimulation to run the simulation

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# Pull information for a single sub-national unit from the site-file
site <- subset_site(
  site = example_site,
  site_filter = data.frame(
  country = "Burkina Faso",
  iso3c = "BFA",
  name_1 = "Sahel",
  urban_rural = "rural")
  )

# Convert site information to malariasimulation parameters
site_par <- site_parameters(
  interventions = site$interventions,
  demography = site$demography,
  vectors = site$vectors$vector_species,
  seasonality = site$seasonality$seasonality_parameters,
  eir = site$eir$eir,
  overrides = list(
    human_population = 1000
  )
)

# Run the model!
site_sim <- malariasimulation::run_simulation(
  timesteps = site_par$timesteps,
  parameters = site_par
)

```

## Installation

You can install the development version of site from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("mrc-ide/site")
```
